Activity 2

4. Explain how the totalSentiment method works, including how youâ€™re using strings and iteration in your solution.


5. Test your starRating method for multiple reviews, including your simple sample review.
a. Do the ratings make sense? Explain why or why not.


b. Describe at least two ways in which you could adjust your totalSentiment method so that your program returns even more reasonable ratings.


A student is writing a starRating method based on his totalSentiment method, which calculates the sum of all of the sentiment values in a review. He comes up with the following:
public static int starRating(String fileName)
{
  double totalSentiment = totalSentiment(fileName);
  if(totalSentiment < 15)
  {
    return 4;
  }
  else if(totalSentiment < 10)
  {
    return 3;
  }
  else if(totalSentiment < 5)
  {
    return 2;
  }
  else if(totalSentiment < 0)
  {
    return 1;
  }
  else
  {
    return 0;
  }
}

6. Explain to the student, using specific examples of (a) what logical error he made in writing his code, and (b) how to fix it.
