Activity 1

1. In this activity you’ll be calling the sentimentVal method. Find this method in the Review class and answer the following questions:
a. Record the method signature in the space below.


b. Does this method require a parameter? If so, what type of parameter is required?
What happens if you pass a different type of parameter instead? (Try it!)


c. Does the method return a value? If so, what is the return type?


2. Write code that tests the sentimentVal method by calling it with several different String parameters and printing out the return value. Any words not in the list will have a return value of zero. Make sure to keep calling the method until you have at least three strings that have a return value other than zero. Record the method calls, including provided strings and return values in the chart below:
Examples:
Method Call               Return Value
sentimentVal(“happily”);  2.32
sentimentVal(“terrible”); -3.38
sentimentVal(“cold”);     -0.04





3. Determine whether or not each statement would compile. Briefly justify your answers.
a. double num = sentimentVal(“warm”);


b. String word = sentimentVal(0.5);


c. double x = sentimentVal(“good”, “bad”);
